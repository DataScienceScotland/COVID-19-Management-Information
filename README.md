# COVID-19-Management-Information

The data provide past data for the daily updates provided at: [https://www.gov.scot/publications/trends-in-number-of-people-in-hospital-with-confirmed-or-suspected-covid-19/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/trends-in-number-of-people-in-hospital-with-confirmed-or-suspected-covid-19/)

The information is collected by Scottish Government from local NHS Boards, NHS 24, Scottish Ambulance Service, Care Inspectorate and Health Protection Scotland.

It is Management Information, which is collected and distributed each day in order to support understanding of the progress of the outbreak in Scotland. The information comes from different administrative systems and as such there may be variations in the quality of the data and is subject to revision if new information becomes available.

More information on the individual data sources can be found at: [https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-data-definitions-and-sources/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-data-definitions-and-sources/)


On Wednesday 22 July, there are planned changes to the coronavirus data on the Scottish Government website. The blog below published on 20 July contains more information on these changes.  https://blogs.gov.scot/statistics/2020/07/20/planned-changes-to-coronavirus-data-page-on-scottish-government-website/.
We will work to reflect these changes in open datasets that we are publishing onto https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/COVID-19-Management-Information and www.statistics.gov.scot as soon as possible, but please note that there will be a delay to publication whilst we do this.  The historic data up to 22 July will still be publicly available in open formats for use and reuse. We thank you in advance for your patience whilst we prioritise these changes in order to make this data available as soon as possible



*Notes*

SCOTLAND DATA 

-- Calls --

The number of calls to 111 includes all calls to this line, whether or not they relate to COVID-19.

The public are asked to call 111 if they have concerns about other conditions and their GP practice is closed – because of this call volumes may be higher at the weekend when practices are closed.

-- Hospital care --

The data include a snapshot of:

(i) the number of people in ICUs across Scotland with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (not the number of people admitted to ICU each day). The breakdown of confirmed or suspected was not collected before 26th March.

(ii) the number of people in hospital across Scotland with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (not the number of people admitted to hospital each day). This figure includes those in ICU. The breakdown of confirmed or suspected was not collected before 26th March. 
 
NHS Boards provide Scottish Government with management information on the numbers of patients in ICU with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at midnight – this is intended to provide information on patients receiving ICU level 3 care. A small number of NHS Boards have some combined ICU/HDU units and provide information on those units. For example, NHS Tayside had included a standalone HDU in returns before 7 April, these are no longer reported in the figures. The Scottish Government will continue to assess the potential data sources available on COVID-19 patients in receipt of level 3 care.

The number of patients reported each day refers to the number of patients overnight, at midnight on the preceding night.

Where Boards do not provide their overnight data in time for the daily publication, the previous day’s data will be used and highlighted on each occasion. The figure will be revised the subsequent day to include the correct data. Figures may also be revised if Boards discover an error and have to resubmit their data. 

Figures will also be revised if Boards discover an error and have to resubmit their data. 

(i) Data on the number of suspected COVID-19 patients published for 1st May was revised for NHS Grampian on 2nd May from 97 to 29 and as such the national total of suspected cases for 1st May was revised from 507 to 439. The respective confirmed or suspected COVID-19 totals therefore changed from 187 to 119, and 1,809 to 1,741. 

(ii) NHS Lanarkshire data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in hospital on 9th May was revised from 126 to 120 and 74 to 72 respectively on 10th May. The national totals of confirmed and suspected were revised from 1,165 to 1,159 and from 420 to 418 respectively. 

(iii) Due to a revision on the Golden Jubilee National Hospital data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in ICU for 13 May, the total figure for Scotland has been revised from 70 to 66.

(iv) Due to a revision on the NHS Fife data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in ICU for 26 May, the total figure for Scotland has been revised from 36 to 35.

(v) Due to a revision on the NHS Lanarkshire data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital for 11 June, the total figure for Scotland has been revised from 613 to 610.

(vi) Due to revisions on the NHS Fife data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital between 30 May and 10 June inclusive, the total figures for Scotland have been revised. 

(vii) Due to revisions on the NHS Lothian data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in hospital and ICU between 17 June and 20 June inclusive, the total figures for Scotland have been revised.


Other minor variations in the daily returns from Boards include:

(i) No submission was received from NHS Dumfries and Galloway on 18/03/2020 or 19/03/2020.

(ii) On some occasions, NHS Lanarkshire figures were collected at 4pm and not midnight.

(iii) Western Isles are defining ICU as beds where intensive ventilation can take place.

Health Boards started to provide data on the breakdown of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 hospitalisation and ICU patients on 26th March with all Boards providing this breakdown from 27t March 2020. From 29 April, NHS Boards are testing all patients aged over 70 on admission to hospital, which has led to a discontinuity in the data series for number of people in hospital. We will continue to monitor the methodology and data being provided by NHS Boards on people in hospital with COVID-19. 


-- Ambulance --

The number of attendances is defined as the number of incidents recorded by SAS, where a resource arrived at the scene.

Updates to past figures can be submitted by SAS so some data may be revised in the future.

-- Delayed Discharges --

Data are as reported daily (Monday to Friday) to Scottish Government by Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCPs).

Data for 04/03/2020 represents the Baseline (weekly return).

Updates to past figures can be submitted to HSCPs so some data may be revised in the future.

-- COVID-19 tests --

The data 5 shows:

(i) the number of people tested for COVID-19 across Scotland to date, with a breakdown for negative and positive. Individuals are counted once even if they have more than one test. Up until 14/06/2020 these figures were based on tests carried out through NHS Scotland labs. From 15/06/2020 they also include numbers of people tested through the UK Government (UKG) testing programme, which were not previously available to Scottish Government. This caused a jump in the cumulative data series when the backlog was all reported on 15 June.

The [Public Health Scotland (PHS) dashboard](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/sharing-our-data-and-intelligence/coronavirus-covid-19-data/) provides a full adjusted time series of cases, based on when people were first tested positive, for NHS Scotland and UKG tests combined.

The total positive cases on 2/6/20 was corrected from 15,741 to 15,471 the same day.

(ii) The daily number of new positive cases of COVID-19 reported in Scotland. Up until 14/06/2020 these numbers are based on tests carried out through NHS Scotland labs only. From 15/06/2020 they also include people tested through the UKG testing programme. Previous data have not been changed to account for the UKG data so the total of the daily numbers is 2275 fewer than the cumulative total.

The [PHS dashboard](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/sharing-our-data-and-intelligence/coronavirus-covid-19-data/) contains a full time series, based on when people were first tested positive, for NHS Scotland and UKG tests combined. 

The daily total of people found positive on 2/6/20 contains 40 historic samples from a NHS Fife laboratory.

(iii) the total number of COVID-19 tests with results in the Health Protection Scotland ECOSS system reported to HPS by the laboratories in the 24 hours from 08:00 to 08:00 that day. This figure is higher than the number of people tested, as people could have more than one test.

With effect from 30/4/20, the total cumulative number of tests includes an additional 2,137 historical tests, which were added to the total following the resolution of technical difficulties.

(iv) the total number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day, and to date by Regional Testing Centres (RTC) as part of the UK Government testing programme, and reported through Department of Health and Social Care based on data from the contractors who operate the centres. This includes tests done at the drive through centres and mobile units, but not home testing kits. The following revisions have been made to these figures:

28/5/20 revised on 29/5/20, reducing by 20, from 1,445 to 1,425. 
6/6/20 was corrected from 1,349 to 1,422.
 
The dates refer to the date the figures were reported on the Scottish Government website. The daily numbers will therefore refer to activity the day before.

Where labs do not provide their overnight data in time for the daily publication, the testing figures will then be added to the return for the subsequent day. Figures may also be revised if labs discover an error and have to resubmit their data. 
 
It should be noted that testing capacity tends to be lower at weekends, and on public holidays.
 
-- NHS staff absences --

The data are provided each day by NHS National Services Scotland on behalf of 21 NHS Boards, and by the Scottish Ambulance Service separately. It covers hospitals and community health services, and excludes those working in general practice. Accuracy and completeness are dependent on frontline services and administrators inputting absence data into the NHS Scotland national time and attendance system (SSTS). The figures cover all staff recorded as absent on the system, irrespective of whether they were due to be at work on that particular day. Recording processes vary between Boards and service areas. In particular, the timing of absence recording will vary, and some absences may not be recorded timeously. We will consider whether it is necessary to update the data for previous days where there is a material change in the reported absence due to a delay in recording. We foresee that services will come under increasing pressure and therefore data will be monitored closely. If necessary, publishing of staff absence data may need to be amended or delayed.

-- Care homes --

Care Inspectorate are notified of suspected COVID-19 cases by service providers. Some care homes were only notifying the Care Inspectorate of the first cases of suspected COVID-19 and therefore may be under reporting the number of cases. On the 17th April 2020, the Care Inspectorate asked care homes to notify every suspected case going forward. Caution is therefore required when considering trends over time.

Two key metrics are used;

*Cumulative figures* are counts since data was first reported and will include cases which are no longer active.

*Current suspected case figures* include only data for which cases are still considered active. The following notes apply:

A case is no longer considered active where a person has not exhibited symptoms for 14 days as per Health Protection Scotland advice.

If no care home residents have exhibited any symptoms for 14 days then this care home is considered to have no current suspected cases.

Data on current suspected cases is available from 21/04/20. For services with current suspected cases, any care home that has notified the Care Inspectorate of a suspected case in the last 14 days has been counted as having a current suspected case, unless an end of current cases notification has been received after the last case was notified. All care homes that have not yet notified the Care Inspectorate of any cases are assumed to have no cases. In addition, care homes who notified the Care Inspectorate of a suspected case at some point but have not reported any further cases in the past 14 days have been contacted by inspectors on the 21/04/20 to record whether the care home still has a current suspected case. 

From 22/04/20 onwards, the Care Inspectorate have set-up a new notification for care homes to report when they no longer have a suspected case in their service. This mechanism will used for reporting going forward. These are incorporated into the figure for 28/04/20 onwards.

Cases are self-reported by care providers and should be considered suspected COVID-19. Some cases may subsequently have a formal positive test, other cases after testing may prove not to be COVID-19 and some cases will not be tested. It is possible not all cases have been reported by all care homes, or there may be a delay in reporting.

All data is based on the date notified to the Care Inspectorate rather than the date of the event, and there may be a lag between these dates. Larger increases tend to occur the first few days of the week as many care homes do not report over the weekend.

On occasion the Care Inspectorate revises figures and these updates are reflected in the figures shown. For cumulative number of care homes that have reported a suspected case, the following revisions were provided:

15/04/20 - previously shown as 470 but revised on 17/04/20 to 444

18/04/20 - previously shown as 459 but revised on 20/04/20 to 462

On occasion the Care Inspectorate revises figures and these updates are reflected in the figures shown. For cumulative number of suspected cases reported, the following revisions were provided:

08/06/20 Data from May 29 onwards revised due to over reporting of case notifications in a small selection of care homes

-- Care home workforce --

This data is reported by care homes to the Care Inspectorate on a weekly basis, via a survey made available each Tuesday, from 21 April 2020.

Reasons for absences related to COVID-19 include those self-isolating, shielding, stress related to COVID-19, at home with symptoms of COVID-19, at home with confirmed (by test) COVID-19, in hospital with symptoms of COVID-19 and in hospital with confirmed (by test) COVID-19.

The data covers all staff recorded as absent on the system, irrespective of whether they were due to be at work on that particular day.

The absence figures for NHS staff and care home staff are calculated in different ways and caution should be exercised in making comparisons.

The number of care homes submitting a return and associated response rate have been revised for the week 19/05/2020 from 940 (87%) to 879 (81%).

-- Deaths --

The data are reported each day by Health Protection Scotland (HPS). This is a cumulative total of deaths since the start of the pandemic in Scotland. Dates shown refer to the day the figure was reported on the SG website.

It includes deaths which have been registered with National Records of Scotland (NRS) where a laboratory confirmed report of COVID-19 in the 28 days prior to death exists. 

The daily total is simply an update of the data described above/previously, using the latest daily information received from NRS to check where a laboratory positive report for COVID-19 exists. These data include all deaths in individuals with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in Scotland and therefore includes deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community.
 
This daily number of new deaths registered will not necessarily equal the number of deaths on a particular day, owing to the time allowed for families to register deaths. Numbers of registrations are also lower at weekends.

From 2nd April [HPS improved the process for reporting](https://www.gov.scot/news/new-process-for-reporting-covid-19-deaths/) this information. The figures for 30th March and 1st April shown here were updated to reflect the new approach and so differ from the numbers reported on the SG website at the time (60 and 76 respectively).

Please note that NRS provide a weekly report of all deaths where COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate (not just confirmed by a test). The [NRS report](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/covid19stats) provides information by age, sex and place of death. It also provides a full explanation of the difference between the two measures.

HEALTH BOARD DATA

-- Cumulative cases --

The data show the cumulative number of people tested positive for COVID-19 across Scotland to date, broken down by board. 
 
Up until 14 June, results reported each day refer to the number of positive tests in the Health Protection Scotland ECOSS system reported to HPS by the laboratories in the 24 hours from 08:00 to 08:00. Therefore, the number of positive tests reported each day refers to the number of individuals with a positive result on the day preceding the notification date. These have been compiled into a cumulative figure for positive tests in Table 1. The daily total of people found positive on 2/6/20 contains 40 historic samples from an NHS Fife laboratory. From 15 June the figures also include people tested through the UK Government's testing programme including drive through, mobile testing units and home tests. The increase on 15 June is due to the addition of all the UKG data on that day.
 
Where labs do not provide their overnight data in time for the daily publication, the figures will then be added to the return for the subsequent day. 

It should be noted that testing capacity tends to be lower at weekends, and on public holidays.
 
Where errors have been found in previous reported numbers, these have been corrected. 

On 13 May, based on updated postcode information, one case has been reassigned from Dumfries and Galloway to Greater Glasgow and Clyde. This resulted in a decrease of one in the total number of cases in Dumfries and Galloway.

On 4 June, also based on updated postcode information, one case has been reassigned from Highland to Forth Valley. This resulted in a decrease of one in the total number of cases in the Highlands.
 
-- ICU and hospital patients --

Data include a snapshot of:

(i) the number of people in ICUs across each Health Board with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (not the number of people admitted to ICU each day). The breakdown of confirmed or suspected was not collected before 26th March. 
 
(ii) the number of people in hospital across each Health Board with confirmed COVID-19 (not the number of people admitted to hospital each day). This figure includes those in ICU. The breakdown of confirmed or suspected was not collected before 26th March. 
 
(iii) the number of people in hospital across each Health Board with suspected COVID-19 (not the number of people admitted to hospital each day). This figure includes those in ICU. The breakdown of confirmed or suspected was not collected before 26th March. From 29th April, NHS Boards are testing all patients aged over 70 on admission to hospital, which has led to a discontinuity in the data series for number of suspected cases in hospital. We will continue to monitor the methodology and data being provided by NHS Boards on suspected COVID-19 cases. In light of this discontinuity, table 3 (total) was split into table 3a (confirmed) and table 3b (suspected) on 5th May.
 
NHS Boards provide Scottish Government with management information on the numbers of patients in ICU with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at midnight – this is intended to provide information on patients receiving ICU level 3 care. A small number of NHS Boards have some combined ICU/HDU units and provide information on those units. For example NHS Tayside had included a standalone HDU in returns before 7th April, these are no longer reported in the figures. The Scottish Government will continue to assess the potential data sources available on COVID-19 patients in receipt of level 3 care.
 
The number of patients in hospital or ICU reported each day refers to the number of patients overnight, at midnight on the preceding night.
 
Where Boards do not provide their overnight data in time for the daily publication, the previous day’s data will be used and highlighted on each occasion. The figure will be revised the subsequent day to include the correct data. Figures may also be revised if Boards discover an error and have to resubmit their data. 

(i) NHS Grampian data on the number of suspected COVID-19 patients on 1st May was revised from 97 to 29 on 2nd May.

(ii) NHS Lanarkshire data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in hospital on 9th May was revised from 126 to 120 and 74 to 72 respectively on 10th May.

(iii) Due to a revision on the Golden Jubilee National Hospital data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in ICU for 13 May, the total figure for Scotland has been revised from 70 to 66.

(iv) Due to a revision on the NHS Fife data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in ICU for 26 May, the total figure for Scotland has been revised from 36 to 35.

(v) Due to a revision on the NHS Lanarkshire data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital for 11 June, the total figure for Scotland has been revised from 613 to 610.

(vi) Due to revisions on the NHS Fife data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital between 30 May and 10 June inclusive, the total figures for Scotland have been revised. 

(vii) NHS Lothian data on the number of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients in hospital and ICU between 17 June and 20 June inclusive have been revised to their current values from 131 confirmed in hospital each day, 193 suspected in hospital and 6 in ICU. The total figures for Scotland have therefor been revised.

Other minor variations in the daily returns from Boards (for tables 2 and 3a and 3b) include:

(i) No submission was received from NHS Dumfries and Galloway on 18th March or 19th March.

(ii) On some occasions, NHS Lanarkshire figures were collected at 4pm and not midnight.

(iii) Western Isles are defining ICU as beds where intensive ventilation can take place.
